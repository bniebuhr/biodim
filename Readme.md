# BioDIM - Biologically scaled Dispersal Model 

This repository is being used to develop and share BioDIM code, data, and manuals.

BioDIM is an individual-based model of animal movement in fragmented landscapes. 
It was initially developed to simulate understory birds in the Brazilian Atlantic rainforest,
and now is being adapted to other taxa and other contexts.
The software runs in a GRASS GIS environment.

BioDIM is being developed at the Spatial Ecology and Conservation Lab, at Universidade Estadual Paulista, Rio Claro, SP, Brazil.
